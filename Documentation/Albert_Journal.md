Today I had started with actually revising my knowledge of Python by reading a Python primer that provided with the refresher I need to get back into the Python development process.I I had initialized the applicaiton section of the django project.Moreover, following the plan which we had created I had started with coding the Django models which are the equivalent to the database schema of typicial SQL databases. I had coded it to be faithful to the source material whihc was the ERD which we had created but there will probably be a need to change the model, however if we do not have to change the models, than we will be satisfied as that would meant hat we had sufficiently planned ahead.

Today I started with actually building the foundation of the app. Firstly I created all fo the views and urls and html templates. The templates I use for this contain only the bare minimum to alow for an easier time in seeing everything work, moreover they are merely a placeholder for when we actually get into the front end design. There are 3 pages which I had created, the uploading page, the image list page, and the result page. The uploading page is where the user will be able to upload the image which they wish to scan, the image list page where the user will eb able to view all of the images which they have uploaded and choose which among them do they wish to select for analyzing, and the resutls page is where the user can view the results of the obejct detection software whcih their image has gone through, the results will be displayed in the form of a list. 

The image detection algorithm used is YOLO, which is able to detect objects within an image with reasonable accuracy and precision. I had managed to integrate the algorithm into the web application relatively smoothly, and it works with no problems.

Today I had refined the output of the algorithm, the algorithm used to just output the individual objects inside of the image, now the objects are counted and shown to the user in a more easily read format, furthermore, the resulting image of the output of the model will be shown as well.
