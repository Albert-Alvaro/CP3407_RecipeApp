# CP3407_RecipeApp

## Project Description
This is a project which aims to combine object detection and AI technology to allow people to simply take a picture of their fridge, and be given a recipe which they can make with the ingredients from inside of their fridge.

The current project is still in development so there will be a significant amount of experimentation that will be done in regards to actually programmning an object detection algorithm
