# In progress:
* Create an entity to store the uploaded images,
##### (Date Started: 16th Mar)
* Create the forms for uploading images using the entity that has been created. 
##### (Date Started: 17th Mar)
* Create a way to push and pull the image data into and from the database entity.
##### (Date Started: 18th Mar)

* Find a dataset that can be used to train a model to recognize ingredients. 
##### (Date Started: 3rd Mar)
* Create code to actually train the model 
##### (Date Started: 3rd Mar)
* Train the model 
##### (Date Started: 7th Mar)
* Test the weights created 
##### (Date Started: 8th Mar)
* Create the code integration for the object detection model in the web application 
##### (Date Started: 10th Mar)

* Understand the architecture and training methods 
##### (Date Started: 18th Mar)
* Decide on the framework or platform to use for implementation (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face) 
##### (Date Started: 19th Mar)

* Get the ingredients detected by the object detection model 
##### (Date Started: 18th Mar)
* Make it so that users will be able to add or delete any of the ingredients that has been detected 
##### (Date Started: 18th Mar)
* Format the ingredients detected such that it is readable
